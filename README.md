# MiniSIEM

A lightweight log analysis tool inspired by Splunk.  
Built for learning SIEM concepts while experimenting with Python.

## Goals
- Collect and store Windows event logs (simulated or real)
- Query logs with basic search & filter
- Detect simple anomalies (e.g., repeated failed logins)
- Provide minimal visualization (counts, graphs)

## Why MiniSIEM?
This project is designed as a learning exercise to:
- Understand how SIEM systems like Splunk work under the hood
- Practice Python, log parsing, and data analysis
- Build a portfolio-ready project in cybersecurity

## Roadmap
- [ ] Log collector (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] Log search and filtering
- [ ] Basic alerting rules
- [ ] Visualization with matplotlib
